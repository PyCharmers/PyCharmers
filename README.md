Introduction to Pycharmers
============

Welcome to Pycharmers! Pycharmers is SLAC's premier intro to Python course. We'll be building this course throughout the semester with your help!

##Getting setup to use Python
While we prefer you to have a Linux or Unix operating system on your computer, we'll still help if you want to use Windows.

### Installing on Linux
Open a terminal and type

```
apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```

### Installing on OS X
Get the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). While Macs come with Python preinstalled, we're going to want to have the latest version of Python 3.

### Installing on Windows
If you don't have Python already installed, and you really don't want to install Linux (hint: you should), you can get the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We'll be using Python 3 for this course.
If you are _really_ dead set on being a Window's dev, make your life a little easier, and check out [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).


## Installing Linux for Windows users
While you have a lot of options for getting Linux on your computer, we recommend getting [VMWare Player](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0), and installing the latest version of [64-bit Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).


## Getting Started
Now that we've all got Python installed, let's try writing some code!

Go ahead and open up a terminal and type `python` then press enter. If you get a message like `'command not found'` try `python3` instead. If that still doesn't work you probably didn't install Python correctly.

If you did install it correctly, you should see something like this:

```
$ python
Python 3.4.1
[GCC 4.2.1]
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Those three arrows pointing to the right tell us we are in the Python interpreter, so any Python code we type here will be executed.

So let's get started.
